Calculate an apartment's real rent with special 'free' months. Use the tool at https://rent.hellotumo.com/.

What does that discounted apartment really cost? Apartment complexes like to give away a month or two on a lease and then advertise a rental rate that reflects a discount incorporating these free chunks of time. Saving money is great, but when those "free months" are up, you'll be faced with a monthly bill that may be a lot more than you expected.  Since 58% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, I suspect many of us don't sit around planning on paying our rent in yearlong timelines. 

Many of us may be unable to handle rent going up even a hundred bucks above an enticing, lower, and misleading number, even though we swore we could manage it.  Avoid a nasty surprise and use the calculator below. If you found this useful, consider donating to me via Paypal (but save money for rent!): https://rent.hellotumo.com/
